# Template to use Makedown, CLS and BibTex to write academic publications

This is a short template that can be used to write scientific
publications with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
[BibTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTex) and the [Citation Style
Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_Style_Language).

How to start:

* Get the right CSL template from the [Citation Style Language
  website](http://citationstyles.org).  Currently the one for PLoS will
  be downloaed if you run *make get_csl*
* Get your list of reference in BibTeX format
* Start editing Manuscript.md
* Run *make pdf* or make *make docx*

Checkout [Scholarly Markdown](http://scholarlymarkdown.com/) which is working
to push this much further.
