# Template to use Makedown and the CLS to write academic publications

This is a short template that can be used to write scientific
publications with markdown, BibTex and the Citation Style Language.

How to start:

* Get the right CSL template - see [Citation Style Language
  (CLS)](http://citationstyles.org).  Currently the one for PLoS will
  be downloaed if you run *make get_csl*
* Get you list of reference in BibTeX format
* Start editing Manuscript.md
* Run *make pdf* or make *make docx*

Checkout [Scholarly Markdown](http://www.scholmd.org) which is plannig
to push this much further.
